## Write-up

The tricky part in this challenge is that Mastodon and its instances aren't indexed within famous OSINT tools. But there are some references that mention it [[ref](https://cipher387.github.io/osint_stuff_tool_collection/#mastodon)], a [tool](https://github.com/C3n7ral051nt4g3ncy/Masto/tree/master) to look up mastodon instances and users.
