# Remote Digital Problems

## Write-up

It is all about using the rdp cache files to recover the Desktop view of the RDP connection.
this can be done using bmc-tools python script and some other tools that parses the .bin cache file to small bitmap images (mainly 64*64).

The flag is echoed in a cmd window in the Desktop.

Tools can be used: <br>
