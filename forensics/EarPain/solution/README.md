## Write-up

The idea was about SSTV Transmission. We can use specific software to decode the audio file to an TV image, for this we can use RX-SSTV software for windows users, while in linux we can use a nice python script made also for this purpose called sstv-decoder; find it here 
https://github.com/colaclanth/sstv , you give it the audio file as an input and it will give you the image as an output in a png format.
