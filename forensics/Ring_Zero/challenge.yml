  > The SOC has escalated a case to you in which a deployment server has been compromised, and attackers may have placed a backdoor in the system. This one should probably be utilized to gain root access.   
  
  > Please retrieve in order:  
  
  >     - backdoor name (with extension).  
  >     - the core adress of the backdoor in memory (in hex).  
  >     - An extra argument has been given to the command that loaded the backdoor (for encryption purposes), but resulted with an *error*. What is the name of this argument.
